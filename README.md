# Showers WIP show
Code for showers sketch, shown at Goldsmiths WIP show 21:01:26

# Description
This programme consists of six identical but independent systems that are used for timing showers. I have built this to be used by a charity called Roots, who provide hot showers for people living in the Calais refugee camp. There are multiple functionalities within this sketch; it can time how long someone has been in a shower and adjust the background colour in response to the timer hitting certain timer-markers. It can be put in certain states (someone is showering, someone is changing, the shower is being cleaned). It can indicate if children are in the shower, updating the timer threshold, and indicating additional safeguarding protocols need to be followed. It also counts how many people have taken a shower within that particular session.
